## Automated Gist update scripts for my profile pins.

  
I just wanted a nicer looking profile, so after having edited my README to perfection, I also added some fancy automated gists as pins. They show really cool stats IMO and uh.. yeah. 


None of these have been created by me! I just changed the workflows to clone their repo, instead of me having to fork it and checking out my fork. This means that my repository tab looks less ugly, while still keeping the same functionality.
